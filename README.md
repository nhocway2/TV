Project Instructions
Run Locally

Navigate to the project directory:
cd your-project-folder

Run the app:
python3 app.py

Open your browser at:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Deploy on Render

Go to the Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com/

Make sure your project is connected to GitHub.

Push your code to GitHub:
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push

Render will automatically deploy your project once changes are pushed.

Tip: Ensure your requirements.txt is up-to-date for Python dependencies so Render can install them automatically.
